# Week 09: Libraries

## Overview

This week we will be looking at techniques for building libraries in Scala. In particular we will look at facilities provided by the Scala programming language for information hiding, types, and stackable traits. We will also investigate the generation of JAR files from Scala that allow libraries to be distributed in an efficient format. In addition, we will see how to search for libraries on Maven Central and include libraries in your SBT environment.
